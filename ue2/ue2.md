######Begriffe

Interrupts:

    An interrupt is a hardware mechanism that enables CPU to detect
    that a device needs its attention.

    Interrupt becomes inefficient when devices keep on interrupting the CPU repeatedly.


Polling:

    Polling is a protocol that notifies CPU that a device needs its attention.
    It's asking the I/O device whether it needs CPU processing.

    Polling becomes inefficient when CPU rarely finds a device ready for service.
